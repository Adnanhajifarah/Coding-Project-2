# Coding-Project-2

1. Miles per Gallon
Write a program that calculates a car’s gas mileage. The program should ask the user
to:

● enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold

● The number of miles that the car can be driven on a full tank

It should then display the number of miles that may be driven per gallon of gas.
Example Output: Your car can drive 10 miles per gallon.

2. Surface Area of a Cylinder
Write a program that calculates the surface area of a cylinder.
Area = 2 π r h+2 π r ^ 2
The program should ask the user to:

● Enter the radius of the cylinder

● Enter the height of the cylinder

It should then display the surface area of the cylinder.
Example Output: the surface area of the cylinder is 10.

3. How many Calories?
A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims there are
10 “servings” in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that
asks the user to input:

● How many cookies they ate

Then output how many total calories were consumed.
Example Output: You consumed 1500 calories.

4. Celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a program that converts celsius temperature to Fahrenheit temperatures.
F = (9/5) C + 32
Example Output: 10 degrees celsius is 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

5. Math Tutor
Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program
should display two numbers to be added (given by the user) such as:

247
+127

The program should pause while the student works on the problem. When the student is
ready to check the answer, they can press a key and the program will display the
correct solution.

247
+127=376
